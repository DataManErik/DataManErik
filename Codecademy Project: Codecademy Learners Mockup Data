-- Codecademy Project: Codecademy Learners Mockup Data

-- Tables: 

-- users table:

  -- user_id
  -- email_domain
  -- country
  -- postal
  -- mobile_app
  -- sign_up_at
  
-- progress table:

  -- user_id
  -- learn_cpp
  -- learn_sql

-- Questions to Answer:  

-- What are the Top 25 schools (.edu domains)? 

SELECT email_domain, COUNT(*) as domain_count
FROM users
GROUP BY email_domain
ORDER BY domain_count DESC
LIMIT 25;

-- How many .edu learners are located in New York?

SELECT city, COUNT(*) as edu_New_York_count
FROM users
WHERE email_domain LIKE '%.edu'
AND city = 'New York';

--The mobile_app column contains either mobile-user or NULL. How many of these Codecademy learners are using the mobile app?

SELECT COUNT(*) AS mobile_app_learners
FROM users
WHERE mobile_app = 'mobile-user';

SELECT sign_up_at, 
  strftime('%H', sign_up_at) AS sign_up_hour, COUNT(*) AS sign_up_count
FROM users
GROUP BY 2
ORDER BY sign_up_count DESC;

-- Do different schools (.edu domains) prefer different courses?
